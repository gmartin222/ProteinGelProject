Contributions of Noah DeMoss:
I added and edited the code that would lead to the determination of molecular weight for each band in the gel. I also created and adapted the code needed to determine the mass of DNA in each band of the gel based on the intensity data. Finally, I added a subset function that edited out the extra bands in cpA1A9_2.csv.
