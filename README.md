# Quantization of DNA Gels 
This repository was created for the central purpose of detailing the protocol for our Project in gsnc3301. A README file was also added for the purpose of explaining the project as well as the maintenance, usefulness and who is in the project. This will allow relative links and images to be defined within parameters of the project.

Computing 2022

We have chosen to use one shared repository whereby cloning on each respective computer will be pushed on the GitHub website. 

Progress: We have attempted to organize our git hub software differentiating our code lines and overall progress. In addition, we have researched potential commands that will be instituted in our project to efficiently quantize protein gels. The following proposition will allow efficient progress between the 3 of us. Person 1 will look at different aspects of the gel and translate that through Git Hub. Person 2 will be the central organizer of the repository and additionally process the data the gel imager gives. Person 3 will compromise a seperate file of code lines that will be sufficient for the quantization of protein gels. 

Goals: Our central goal is to be able to complete this project within the month of April and prior to our capstone presentations. Also, through careful research, we hope to reach an attainable method for not only quantizing protein gels, but to also pave a way for future students to utilize and modify our proposed project. 

Resources: Here are some resources that will aid us in our coding procedure as well as Gel. The other source that will be used involves a block code chain
