Gel electrophoresis is a method that uses agarose gel and electricity to separate 
mixtures of DNA, RNA, or proteins accoriding to molecular size. We will be using this
gel electrophoresis in its protein separating capacity. The goal of our computing proect
is to create a program that aids us in reading and deciphering the products of a gel
electrophoresis experiment.

A current program that is available, but that could be improved, has the name IMAGEJ.
IMAGEJ is a javabased image processing program developed by the National Institutes of Health
and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation. It can be used to display, annotate,
edit, calibrate, measure, analyze, process, print, and save raster image date. Raster image data would include
a raster image of a gel electrophoresis separation of protein which is what we hope to use. 

Another program worthy of looking at and emulating would be a program by the name of EgyGene GelAnalyzer4.
This program aims to make a powerful and easy all-in-one gel image analysis software. It is made of 6 key parts
which are:

gel image enhancement - helps gel image color and clarity
image analysis - automatic and manual detection of lanes and bands
data merging - merging several analyses for different samples/gels together to produce one table
molecular markers detection - collects several pre-analyzed data for the same samples to detect their molecular markers
phylogenetic tree prediction - uses the outputs of the previous parts to draw the phylogenetic tree between samples
population parameters estimation - calculates the population parameters for the pre-analyzed images

We hope to create a code/program that quantizes proteins from gel electrophoresis with our knowledge of RSTUDIO
and our research of succesful gel analyzing softwares currently available to the market.
